# Child-Minding-Website

# Overview
This project was for my A-Level Computer Science coursework in 2019.

# User needs
The client needs me to create a system that stores customer information, this would be done by using a database. My client will also need to be able to select the dates and times she is available to look after the children which will then be viewable to the customers. Some other features that my client will need included is the ability to add and remove bookings manually if she is not available at certain times. She will also need to be able to generate a report on database queries which can be easily done as she doesn’t have any experience with SQL languages or databases. The customers will also be using the system, it should allow them to register to the website if they are new and then let the log back in once they have registered. Once the customers are logged in they should be able to change their contact information if it changes and be able to book session depending on when my client is available to look after their children.

# Objectives
1.	The first screen will be the home page which will provide some brief information about the business and the services that my client provides. 
2.	Be able to register to the website, enter all their information and then log in once the customer has registered.
3.	The system should be able to store all this information in a database which can then be used to make bookings.
4.	The client will also be able to log in using an admin login which gives her access to the all the information about her customers, their children and bookings.
5.	My client will be able to find contact information of the parents if need be from the admin dashboard.
6.	Bookings will not be available on the weekends so this will have to be blocked in the calendar.
7.	Once the customers have logged in they will be brought to their main dashboard which will provide an overview of the information which is held on the system as well as any sessions that they have booked for their child.
8.	This dashboard page will allow the parents to update account information, this will let them change contact information.
9.	The customer’s information must be protected to stop unauthorised viewing at any time.
10.	When the customer wants to make a booking they will be able to select the date they want and select the length of the desired session. The price of the booking will simultaneously be calculated and displayed to the user.
11.	The booking will cost more depending on the rate for each child which will be notified when the customer registered to the website.
12.	The customer should also be able to pay for the sessions over PayPal which my client can view on her account.
13.	My system would also give my client the ability to add, edit or remove bookings.
14.	The system must also be able to view, add, edit and remove customer information if it changes or my client needs to view it to contact the customer.
15.	When bookings are made it is checked to make sure that no two bookings overlap as to avoid a double booking.
16.	My client will be able to see all of her customer’s bookings in a clear, and easy to understand format.
17.	My client must also be able to see all of her bookings on the website using different devices other than a computer.
18.	When the customer arrives with their child to check in my client will be able to check their information in the customer database or provide their booking ID, this will make sure that they are the correct people who made the booking.
